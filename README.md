# ITML
The web, for a more civilized age.

## Preface
As many of you are well aware, the web is becoming a ravid and hungry place, and the available job openings are drastically decreasing. It's so _easy_ nowadays to be a web developer. Too easy, as I believe. I am sure I speak for many when I say, change needs to happen, and it won't happen with us sitting idle whilst the inferior programmers take our jobs, our money, and our livelyhoods.

## What is ITML?

ITML (an acronym of "Idle-text Markup Language") is the ultimate test to any programmer who thinks he is a true developer.

(more to be added.)

## How do I use it?
